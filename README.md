# File-Organizer-Script
A script that organizes files in a specified directory into subdirectories based on file type (e.g., all .txt files go into a “TextFiles” folder).


Step by Step Algorithm:

1. Ask the user to define the path of the source directory containing the file to be organized.
2. Ask the user to define the path of the Destination.
3. Define the Category - It is important to define the categories you want to organize based on the types of files stored in the directory. 
   I have witten some basic categories in which usually files are found.
4. Write the program using Python built-in functions to sort the files in the directory and to move the files to the correct directory.
